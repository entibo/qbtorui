fix vlc protocol with filename containing spaces PLEASE
keyboard navigation
  up/down move between torrents
  space or enter
    torrent: toggle expand file list
    file: download
  left/right move between columns
    torrent: delete, archive, expand
    file: priority, play, download
move the "local" download folder from vlc:// link to the vlc utility itself
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
git / push to github
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
show "active" state on Play button 
style filter input
show torrent as selected? no
filter feature
  type to start filtering
  this focuses a text input at top of page
  use display: none to filter?
  escape to clear input
figure out a "public" folder that gets uploaded
  van.d.ts can't be separated from its .js counterpart
  so it must live in "public"?
  i guess that's fine
remove extension indicator
omit path common prefix
bug: incomplete file has link
bug: paused/"do not download" show as green "downloading"
make sure files request goes through on click (not INTERVAL later)
spacing of torrent entries and files
padding at the top so that first item isn't at top of screen
numbers: faded leading zeros 
instant feedback when clicking a torrent
file download priority: normal / high / none
hover color less dark
play button (for vlc protocol)
remove Delete button from ratio
  move to date? left of date?
archive feature
  button (where?)
  use order: 9999 to push to bottom of page?
